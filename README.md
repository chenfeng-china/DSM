The DSM deep semantic model, also known as DCSN (Dynamic Cognitive Semantic Network), is the specific implementation of DCN dynamic cognitive network (http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04551) for natural language and semantic expression and processing.  
This project is an earlier version, which contains the basic model definition of DSM, the basic knowledge base, and the principle demonstration of algorithms such as description, understanding, generation, query, transformation, inference, and learning.  
The main features of DSM are as follows:  
The overall DSM model consists of two models, semantics and language, and semantics and language are completely separated.  
The basic structure is similar to triples, but more powerful. Use this unified structure to express a variety of semantic and linguistic knowledge.  
Semantic model construction adopts a top-down approach to form a pyramid-shaped knowledge and information structure.  
The language model adopts a tree network structure. Similar to AMR abstract semantic representation, but more complete and specific.  
Semantic models and language models are mapped and transformed.  
All kinds of knowledge in the model use probabilistic expressions comprehensively.  
Realize the closed loop of the algorithm system including understanding, generation, query, reasoning, computation, and learning around the basic model.  
Various calculations are combined with probabilities to select the results with the best comprehensive score.  
  
DSM深度语义模型又可以称为DCSN（动态认知语义网络），是DCN动态认知网络(http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04551)针对自然语言和语义表达和处理的具体实现。  
本项目是一个较早期的版本，其中包含了DSM的基本模型定义、基本知识库以及描述、理解、生成、查询、转换、推理、学习等算法的原理演示。  
DSM的主要特点如下：  
DSM整体模型由语义和语言两个模型构成，语义和语言彻底分离。  
基本结构结构类似三元组，但更为强大。用这个统一结构表达各种语义和语言知识。  
语义模型构建采取自顶向下方法，形成金字塔形的知识和信息结构。  
语言模型采用树形网结构。类似AMR抽象语义表示，但更为完整和具体。  
语义模型和语言模型进行映射转换。  
模型中各种知识全面地采用概率表达。  
围绕基本模型实现包括理解、生成、查询、推理、计算、学习在内的算法体系闭环。  
各种计算结合概率，选取综合打分最优的结果。
